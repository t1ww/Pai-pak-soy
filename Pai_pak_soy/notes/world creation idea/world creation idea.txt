so we have grid for towns and other static areas

// example with small one represents tiers with "t"
[beach, town t3, town t2 or 3, town t1 or 2, town t1, first_town, town t1, town t1 or 2, town t2 or 3, town t3, beach] landed area

now going from town to town player have to pass "unsafe area" which its the combat zone with enemies and resources to collect
will also have it's tier and encounter will based on destination town

such as going from 1 to 2 player will start into t1 unsafe area and may find doors for t1 or t2 unsafe area

each of unsafe area will have chance of 3 - 4 doors ( 75/45 chance )
 - for 3 doors [ 70% ? same : higher tier , 70% ? same : higher tier , high : door]
 - for 4 doors [ 70% ? same : higher tier , 70% ? same : higher tier , high : door]
